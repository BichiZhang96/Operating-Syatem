Project 5 – This is a Group Project

The purpose of this project is to implement the Simple File System. The project is based on the version from Notre Dame University with a few modifications.

Modifications:
•	To keep the project simple, indirect pointers will only be implemented for extra credit. Therefore, file size will be limited to 5 block size
•	The free data block list (bitmap), is constructed upon mounting the drive
•	The “inode” blocks are loaded into memory upon mounting the disk. The “inode” blocks are written back to disk (if dirty) upon exiting the program.
•	The project was design for Linux; our version is designed for windows.
